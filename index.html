            <p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist
                James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2]
                The group's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four"
                bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding
                members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert
                Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and
                bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are
                former members of the band.
                Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its
                first five albums.[3] The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described as one of the heaviest
                and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to
                root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial
                success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album
                of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the
                band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which
                drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums.
                In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band
                and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material
                without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was
                the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the
                sometimes troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles
                within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band
                wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which
                the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
                Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles
                and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums
                (beginning with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks
                as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide
                as of 2018.[4] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as
                Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[5] As of 2017,
                Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991,[6]
                selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.[7]</p>

                Over 30 years on, it’s still hard to overestimate the impact Metallica’s Master Of Puppets had on the world.
                Their most profound and emphatic musical statement, it would come to define them, and with the death of bass
                player Cliff Burton on that album’s tour, it book-ended an era for the quartet, while their new-found status
                as one of the most important metal band on the planet to risked toppling to that of just another infamous
                rock act forever marred by a gruesome fatality.
                For those of us still marvelling at their unparalleled and sophisticated leap from the Kill ’Em All debut to
                their Ride The Lightning album, Master was a whole other level of erudition. Strange to think now that there
                was outrage in some quarters when they introduced acoustic guitars to the audience at Hammersmith Odeon on
                the Lightning tour. Though if their audience and critics were still clinging to the past, Metallica were
                marching purposefully forward to the beat of their own drum (toms and double bass drums, mostly), setting
                the spark to the flame of a genuine musical revolution.
